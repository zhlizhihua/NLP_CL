SENSORS CAN'T SPOT NEW YEAR'S GUNSHOTS

   Despite a high-tech effort to stamp out the firing of guns into
the air during New Year's eve, falling bullets wounded a sheriff's
deputy and a 12-year-old boy in separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Their wounds weren't serious. The off-duty deputy took a bullet
in the shoulder while celebrating the holiday with friends in
Temple City, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. The boy, in
South-Central Los Angeles, was hit by a small bullet that lodged in
his scalp until doctors plucked it out with tweezers.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries came as a depressing reminder for police of the
tradition's enduring popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't think about the consequences,'' said Sgt. Larry
Meyer with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, north of L.A.
``Those bullets do come down somewhere. They don't just
evaporate.''
</P>
<P>
   A new surveillance system designed to pinpoint the location of
gunfire was overloaded with fireworks, masking gunfire. After the
stroke of midnight, a barrage of 700 tiny explosions flooded the
Shotspotter system's acoustic sensors. Most of the blasts were
probably fireworks, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Deputy
Bruce Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A backfire, a gunshot, a firecracker they're all going to
sound the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the sheriff's department received 323 phoned-in
reports of gunshots throughout the entire county, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers at police stations throughout Los Angeles estimated
they took fewer complaints than last year about celebratory
gunfire. The drop, they said, was probably caused by the same cold,
damp weather that doused many of the city's official millennium
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, someone in Temple Heights was blazing away shortly after
midnight. Sheriff's Deputy Steven Toly, 37, was standing outside a
house on Golden West Avenue when a bullet fell from the sky and
pierced his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bullet was quickly removed, Toly was expected to
remain hospitalized Saturday night so doctors could watch for signs
of infection, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Central Los Angeles, a 12-year-old boy watching the New
Year's festivities outside was struck in the head by a .22-caliber
bullet. The boy, whose name was withheld by police, was rushed to a
hospital, where doctors removed the bullet and sealed the wound
with two stitches, said Officer Trevion Stokes of the Los Angeles
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made in either case.
</P>
<P>
   Catching those responsible for such senseless injuries is
difficult at best, authorities say. Bullets can travel far before
falling back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he heard automatic gunfire in the distance Sunday
morning from his Oxnard home. But even he didn't bother to report
it to police, since he had no idea where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you get someone to tell you, it was that guy right
there, it's very difficult to make an arrest,'' he said.
